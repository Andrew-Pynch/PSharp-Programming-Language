# P# Programming Language
P Sharp is my stab at creating a programming language that combines my favorite 
elements from different languages. Key points include...

## Compiled Language

## Strongly Typed

# Syntax
## Imports
```python
import packageName as name
```

## Math
```python
** = Exponent
%  = Modulus
// = Integer Division
/  = Division
*  = Multiplication
-  = Subtraction
+  = Addition
```

## Boolean Operators
```cs
true
false
```

## Logic Operators
```python
== = Equal to 
!= = Not equal to
<  = Less than
>  = Greater than
<= = Less than or Equal to
>= = Greater than or Equal to

is = return true if a is b
is not = return true if a is not b
```

## Declaring variables with types
```cs
name string = 'andrew';
```

## Functions
```cs
functionName returnType(parameter1 string) {
    print('Hello world!');
}
```

## Loops
```cs
// For loops 
for variable in condition {
    if (condition == true) {
        keep doing thing
    }
    else {
        break
    }
}

//  While loops
while condition {
    if (condition == true) {
        keep doing thing
    }
    else {
        break
    }
}
```

## Arrays
```cs
// Declaring a new array!!!
names List<string> = ['Andrew', 'James'];
```

## Comments
```cs
// this is a comment homie
```

## Print
```python
print('thing');
```

# Casting variables
```cs
age string = '100';
// cast string age to an int
int(age);
```
